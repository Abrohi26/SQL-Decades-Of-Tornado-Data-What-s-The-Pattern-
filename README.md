 SQL Decades Of Tornado Data: What is The Pattern <br />
 This project aims to analyze tornado data from 1950 - 2022 and answer questions I developed myself. <br />	
1. "Is there any noticeable upward trend in tornados in our 75 years of history?" <br />
2.  "As Tornado equipment became more sophisticated and warnings became more prevalent did this reduce casualties?" <br />
3. "Which State has more tornados on average?"
